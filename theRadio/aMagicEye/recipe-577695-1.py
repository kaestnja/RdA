# MagicEye.py
#
# A simple animation DEMO to simulate the action of a thermionic tuning indicator valve/tube.
# The valve/tube type is EM87, 6HU6, CV10407, 6E2 and other equivalent numbers too.

# Save the file as MagicEye.py in the Lib and/or Modules drawer/directory/folder.
# To test from a normal Python Command Prompt/Terminal call as......
#
# >>> import MagicEye
#
# ......and away you go and enjoy... ;o)
#
# Tested on Windows Vista using Python 2.6.2 and Debian Linux using Python 2.6.6.
# Also tested on PCLinusOS 2009 using Python 2.5.2... (All are default installs.)
# This code assumes white foreground and black background colours.
#
# Written in such a way that anyone can understand how it works!
# This code CAN be simplified quite a lot but it has been left as is...
#
# It is useful for quick glance readings from say an 8 bit ADC used as a simple level
# indicator, for example a tuning and/or level indicator.
# It is at 5 bit depth.
#
# The commands, "CLS" and "clear" are used and assumed to always be available for both platforms...
